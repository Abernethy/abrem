		Entering revisions to utilize abremPivotals according to original design will add a fourth development digit to version number
		0.1.23.1
2014-11-02 Jurgen Symynck <jusy@openreliability.org>

        * upgraded abrem 0.1.21 to 0.1.23 (development version)
		* many bugfixes, manual cleanup;
		* Uses packages debias 0.1.9 (available on r-forge) and abremPivotals 0.2.9 (available on github, commit ID 2b08a98): This release uses the getPPP(na.rm=...) option that will be dropped in future abremPivotals and abrem releases.
		* Added "canvas" option to specify type of plotting canvas to be used (option "log" is still present). The canvas type now shows in the plot.
		* Added "axes" option to omit specified axes on the plot, added "frame.plot" argument to plot a frame around the plot. The default plot now only has lower and left axes.
		
		* Abrem.R (Abrem): dropped support for "time" and "fail" arguments, in favor of the default "x", to be consistent with abremPivotals and abremDebias.
		* calculateSingleFit.R (calculateSingleFit):
		dropped support for "rr2", "mle2", "mle3", "mle-rba2" and "mle-rba3". The decision was made that the C++ code should be the default, while the R code (lm(), optim(), ...) is only provided as an example. "rr2" has been replaced by adding an option "use.lm" in argument "method.fit".
		* calculateSingleConf.R (calculateSingleConf):
		Added support for limiting the confidence bounds to the unreliability levels to those that were explicitly passed using argument 'unrel'.

        * upgraded abrem 0.1.14 to 0.1.21:
		Made the switch to package abremPivotals, eliminating the dependancy on the outdated pivotals package. Problematic depencancies on Rcpp and RcppArmadillo were removed. Split some functions into separate files.

        * upgraded abrem 0.1.12 to 0.1.14:
		General man page updates and reorganization, more error checking, added support for subtracting threshold parameters from the data before plotting, replaced "bernard" with "benard", renamed option "blives" to "unrel", renamed option "conf.n" to "unrel.n", added some debugging datasets and a mixed model (synthetic) dataset.
		Many more modifications to the code for debugging and (currently) undocumented features. (choose fit calculation code, choose confidence calculation code, plot superSMITH reports ...)
		Removed the two "vignettes" that used to be accessible with browseVignettes(), but not anymore since R 3.1.
		
		* Abrem.R (Abrem): added support for arguments of class "numeric", 
		* plot.abrem.R (plot.abrem): "main" title now plots without overlapping the top x-axis labels
		* options.abrem.R (options.abrem): added option "mar", added some previously undocumented options, placed options in alphabetical order.

        * upgraded abrem 0.1.8 to 0.1.10:
        General man page cleanup and reorganization. Moved the detailed description of some options to the manpage of the most approporiate function.
        added support for contour calculation.
        removed abrem:::MLEw3p_secant.r; now calling the version in package debias.
        removed abrem:::MRRw3pxy; now calling the version in package debias.
        
        * Abrem.R (Abrem): added fail and susp argument options
        * options.abrem.R (options.abrem): added in.legend logical option for
        * calculateSingleConf.R (calculateSingleConf): named likelihood ratio bounds to "lrb" instead of "lira"
        * calculateSingleFit.R (calculateSingleFit): reduced length of file; more efficient code reusage.
        
2013-11-02 Jurgen Symynck <jusy@openreliability.org>

        * upgraded abrem 0.1.7 to 0.1.8:
        Added missing information (specifically about dist and method.fit) in several man pages.
        General man page cleanup and reorganization.
        Change dependencies to debias (>= 0.1.7) and pivotals (>= 0.1.9)
        
        * calculatesinglefit.R (CalculateSingleFit): replaced RBAw() with RBAbeta()
